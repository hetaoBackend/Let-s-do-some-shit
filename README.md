**Great engineers for great companies!**

For the Hiring Recruiter, it is very hard to find a suitable software engineer for the company, and it's not effective to find talented developer in a specific fields. For example, when The BizReach encounter a technical problem with Elasticsearch, we may have no idea where the elasticsearch expert are. Our product will measure a developer in five dimensions(**technical, communication, innovation, engagement, diversity**), and help you find the most professional engineers.

## Idea
- Account System
- Ml to extract some features
- dynamic chart to show the relationship between talents
- Performance metrics of the dev

## Technologies

### Frontend
  - React
  - Echarts

### Backend
  - Flask
  - MySql
  - Docker & Docker-compose
  - Style Check for code

### Machine Learning
  - PageRank
  - Graph Embedding
  - Tone analysis for commit messages
  - Efforts to search code based on queries

## Appeal point

- Relation Display by modern frontend framework and fancy UI.
- Use NLP techniques to understand PR introduction, and the result is used to generate the communication score for developer.
- Code style/quality analysis
- PageRank based on github relationship
- Similar developer recommendation based on graph embedding techniques.
- Category filter for recruiter's convenience to find suitable engineers.
